# Safari adventure game

This project was completed for the Interactive Multi Media module
 
In this project, my team and I developed a video game using the Unity game engine in C++. 

The game was an endless runner style game where players, a safari ranger, would dodge oncoming animals by sidestepping, jumping over or using a myriad of powerups. 

The project implemented various animations, visual and sound effects to give a more immersive experience. 

Upon completion of this project as a part of its assignment my team and I made a detailed video explaining all sections of the project code and what they did, with clips of the running game to show these features in action.
